  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>School is a big part of my life - it's a big part of nearly everybody around the globe's life. And I can't say that I love school, but it is nevertheless
    <em>really</em> important, and has taught me a lot, both academically and socially. Some of my habits today developed from school, and I met my best friends in school.</p>
    <p>This webpage will review my tumultous schooling history, and how all of the six schools I have attended have shaped me to become who I am today, and who I will be in the future.</p>
  </div>
  <!-- elementary school -->
  <div id="elementary">
    <h2>Elementary School</h2>
    <p>I went to four different elementary schools. They were <a href="https://www.ccsd93.com/cloverdale" target="_blank">Cloverdale</a> (for kindergarten),
      <a href="https://muir.sd54.org/" target="_blank">John Muir Literacy Academy</a> (for first grade), <a href="https://einstein.sd54.org/" target="_blank">Albert Einstein Elementary School</a> (for gardes two, three, and half of four), and
      <a href="https://einstein.sd54.org/" target="_blank">Hoover Math and Science Academy</a> (from half of fourth grade through sixth grade).</p>
      <h3>Cloverdale</h3>
      <p>In Cloverdale, I remember my teacher, Mrs. Mu√±oz. She taught me many life skills, such as always speaking the truth, not to steal, and basically just introduced me to how school would be. She was a very nice person, who always brought treats for us during one of her Jewish holidays. I still remember when she brought steaming hot latkes
        and dreidles for us to play with during Hannukah. Kindergarten in Cloverdale was fun, and I will miss those good old times. </p>
      <img src="img/cloverdale.jpg" width="300" height="150">
      <p class="caption">Cloverdale Elementary School, Carol Stream, IL</p>
      <h3>John Muir</h3>
      <p>I remember very little of my one year at John Muir Literacy Academy. We had moved from Bloomingdale, IL to Hoffman Estates, and this was to be my new school. I don't even remember my teacher's name, and John Muir is only significant in my mind because it is where I met my best friend for the rest of elementary school - Aditya. Aditya was a really smart kid, but he was down to earth, unlike some of the other geniuses in my class.
        We quickly hit off, and were inseperable until he moved when I was in fourth grade. But I would say that my experience at John Muir was, although unmemorable, not bad either.</p>
      <img src="img/johnmuir.jpg" width="300" height="100">
      <p class="caption">John Muir Literacy Academy, Hoffman Estates, IL</p>
      <h3>Einstein</h3>
      <p>Einstein was my favorite elementary school, by far. I had my favorite teacher, Ms. Astrug, for one-and-a-half years, and I really enjoyed my time there. In second grade, I was new to the school, and just began to make new
        friends. But my third grade, I had really fit into the school, and made it my second home. Ms. Astrug really understood us third graders, and made class fun and engaging for us. I think everyone of us in her third grade class still remembers her today, and how positively she affected us.</p>
      <p>I was only completed half of fourth grade year in Einstein before we moved, and part of me wished that we didn't back then. I was leaving my favorite teacher of all time, and my friends that I had made for two-and-a-half years behind. But now when I reflect on my move, and I think it led to something as great as my Einstein experience.</p>
      <img src="img/einstein_elementary.jpg" width="300" height"100">
      <p class="caption">Albert Einstein Elementary School, Hanover Park, IL</p>
      <h3>Hoover Math and Science Academy (HMSA)</h3>
      <p>The last elementary school I went, and the one I graduated from, is the one which is in my memory that most. I made some of my best friends that I have today in Hoover, and the <a href="211_Squad_Website/211_squad_landingpage.html" target="_blank"> Homeroom 211 Squad</a> are still tight to this day. I learnt a lot at Hoover,
         from math and science skills (shout out to Mrs. Villareal who really made me recognize my talent for math), but also social and survival skills when we went on a field trip to <a href="https://www.ymcachicago.org/duncan/">Camp Duncan</a>, an experience which profoundly changed my outlook on the natural world.
         Hoover taught me a lot, and most of what I learned has still stuck with me to this day, just the friends I made over there will be with me forever.</p>

    </div>
    <!-- junior high -->
    <div id="jrhigh">
      <h2>Junior High</h2>
      <p>Unlike my tumultous elementary school journey, I went to the same junior high for both of my years of middle school - Jane Addams Junior High.</p>
      <img src="img/addams.jpg" width="300" height="100">
      <p class="caption">Jane Addams Junior High, Schaumburg, IL</p>
      <p>Addams served as a very important stepping stone between my kiddie years in elementary school to a more mature young adult in high school for me. <p>I was also in the Dsicovery Gifted program, and I was with like minded people for almost every class. Some of my best friends are from my Discovery class in Addams.</p>
      <p>I learned even more in Addams, I loved my electives - STEM, Spanish, and Media. This was the first
        time that <em>I</em> got to choose my classes, and I loved the experience of learning something I did not learn before. In fact, I loved Spanish and the coding we did in STEM 1 so much that I'm continuing those elective courses in high school right now: I am enrolled in Spanish 2 for Freshmen and AP Computer Science Principles.
     My interest in both of these courses developed in junior high, and this is another reason I have to be grateful for this short yet sweet time in my life.</p>
      <p>My love for social studies was also discovered in junior high. I was the school History Bee Champion in both seventh and eighth grade (in seventh grade I competed in the National finals in Atlanta), and was the school National Geographic Geography Bee champion (I was a state finalist). And the person who made me realize my prowess in social studies was none other than my own social studies teacher, Mr. Glesne.
        He helped me recognize my potential, and with his and my parents' guidance, I went to the finals of these prestigious tournaments. I have a lot to owe Addams, and I will miss it and all it had to offer for me forever.</p>
      <img src="img/ss.png" width="300" height="100">
      <p class="caption">Addams made me discover my aptitude for social studies, and I competed under the Addams banner in several social studies competitions.</p>

    <div id="highschool">
        <h2>High School</h2>
        <p>And now I am in highschool. After eight years of schooling, I had finally reached the final stage of my school journey. I had graduated from Addams as a smarter, more athletic, and overall better person than I was before, and now I was ready to take on high school.
          That was a few months ago, in the summer, and now I love this new aspect of my life. I love all of my classes: Spanish, Algebra 2, English, Biology, Freshman Foundations, Physical Education, AP Seminar, and certainly AP Computer Science Principles! And I especially like our block scheduling, in which
           we have "A" and "B" days. We have four classes on "A" days, and the other four classes on "B" days. I like this idea of having a class a maximum of three times a week because it lets me do my "A" day homework on the "A" day, and allows me to check over the homework on the "B" day, and then I can turn it in on the next "A" day. Basically, the block scheduling allows me to have two days to do my homework - <em>awesome!</em></p>
           <p>Another reason that love Hoffman Estates High school because of how many different ways it is possible to get involved. I am a proud member of the Boys Freshman A Soccer Team, and I am interviewing to be the Winter Musical Producer (I'm crossing my fingers right now, hoping that I get that pretigious position!), and a member of the chess team.
          Hoffman Estates does an awesome job of preparing us for the real world, in which getting involved in the community is vital for success and happiness. I love this high school and everything it stands for, and I hope I will feel this way about HEHS for all four years of my remaining high school journey.</p>
