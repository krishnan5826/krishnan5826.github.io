    <p>What Exactly is Computer Science?</p>
    <br>

    <p>What exactly is computer science (CS), a relatively new field which is rapidly becoming an interesting and lucrative area of study, work, and even recreation? Well, the dictionary states that CS is “the study of the principles and use of computers.” And although this is the technical meaning of CS, that is not all there is to this alluring subject.</p>
    <br>
    <p>According to the University of Maryland’s computer science website, there are two main aspects of the gigantic field of CS. The first aspect entails the study of a wide variety of topics that fall under the umbrella of CS: artificial intelligence (AI), computer systems, cybersecurity, data management/databases, numerical analysis, programming, software engineering, hardware engineering, and several more. The second aspect of CS is the more important one. This second facet is how a computer scientist can use his or her knowledge of one or more of the aforementioned topics to solve an existing problem, whether it is abstract or tangible.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Now that CS has been defined, some misconceptions about it will be debunked. The biggest one may be that CS is just about coding. In fact, as aforementioned, CS includes a variety of areas of study, such as AI, and not just programming. Another misconception is that computer literacy (the study of how to use a computer and its programs) is the same as CS. This is NOT true. CS deals with the actual science and workings of computers and their applications, while computer literacy deals with using computers efficiently.</p>
    <br>
    <p>CS has touched almost every industry and field of study in the past few decades. In the robotics industry, AI is used to build the brain of the robot to ensure its functionality. In the healthcare industry, computers and robotic equipment are used in surgeries to ensure precision. And in the education system, because of computer scientists in the past, more and more school work is being completed online (for example the use of iPads in high schools across the nation), transforming the way children were educated for decades.</p>
    <br>
    <p>CS is revolutionizing the world, and the first step to being a part of this change is to learn about this fascinating science.</p>
