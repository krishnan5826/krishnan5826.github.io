<h1> Largest 'headline' tag, generally only used once in a webpage </h1>

<h2> Slightly smaller than h1 :) </h2>

<h3> Headings go all the way down to h6 </h3>

<h4> In general, the headline tag is not considered the content - but the title of the content </h4>

<p> This tag is used for regular text... aka your actual content </p>
<br> <!-- creates a line break, like the ENTER button on the keyboard -->
<br>

<p>You need to be careful with how much text you type at once when content goes off the screen in your web browser, it will
automatically word wrap. When viewing this in a web browser, try shrinking your browser window to see what will happen. blah
