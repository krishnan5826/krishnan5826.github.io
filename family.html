    <h1 style="text-align: center;">My Family</h1>
    <p>My family is extremely important to me. They help me get through tough times by graciously
    offering their kind words and support, and also congratulate me and make me keep going when I succeed.
  The people that I will list in this table are great people, and deserve the recognition given to them here - because if it weren't for them
I would not be how I am today.</p>

She always supports me, and is a great friend as well as a grandmother.</td>

In fact, one of my strongest childhood memories is of her cooking in the kitchen and quizzing me on my times tables. She has taught me a lot, and always boosts my confidence when I'm feeling a little low - and for that, I will be eternally grateful.</td>

    <p>The people listed above are not the only ones who are special to me - there are many more who, although they are not present
      on my table, are present in my heart as great people who I look up to and respect. Some of them are: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Arvind Mama (maternal uncle): my <em>mama</em> (the Tamil word for "uncle") is a really great guy. He is really funny, and is so fun to be around. In short, he's awesome.</li>
      <li>Hema Mami (maternal aunt): my <em>mami</em> is a really great lady who has been a role model for me since I met her. She is always calm and collected, and is extremely smart. I look up to her, and she's a fabulous person.</li>
      <li>Pranav and Vaishnavi (maternal cousins): my cousins, Pranav (aged 7) and Vaishnavi (aged 11 months) are really sweet kids who are great to be around. Pranav is a bubbly boy full of energy, and Vaishnavi is probably the cutest baby one could see.</li>
